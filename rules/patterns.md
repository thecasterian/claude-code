# Common Patterns

## Skeleton Projects

When implementing new functionality:
1. Search for battle-tested skeleton projects
2. Use parallel agents to evaluate options:
   - Security assessment
   - Extensibility analysis
   - Relevance scoring
   - Implementation planning
3. Clone best match as foundation
4. Iterate within proven structure
